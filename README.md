# 🌌 Solar System Simulation 

A simulation of the solar system showcasing the motion of the planets orbiting the sun. This project visually represents how each planet travels along its orbital path, demonstrating concepts like orbital speed, distance from the sun, and planetary scale.

## 🚀 Features

- Realistic orbital motion of planets around the sun  
- Scaled distances and orbital periods (optionally simplified for visualization)  
- Each planet is visually distinct with unique colors and sizes  
- Optional labels to display planet names near their orbits  
- Interactive or animated solar system view
- Diverse informations about each planet

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- CSS
- JavaScript
- HTML5   

## 🎮 How to Use

- Launch the simulation to see planets orbiting the sun.
- Click to enable planet name labels.
- Click on a planet to see facts about that specific planet.

## 📚 Educational Value

This simulation helps visualize and understand:

- Planetary motion  
- Orbital periods  
- Relative distances and sizes in the solar system
